# Nextjs-learning-chakraui

I did all working on this and pushed time to time on repository "nextjs-learning"
but in that repo there were already three projects, 
I was using that repo on the Vercel too for deploying the projects
And when I tried to deploy my fourth project which is "panaverse-dao-web", I got an error on vercel that one repository can only be used for max of three projects deployment
Because we are using free account over vercel

So that's why I have created this repository and moved my project here
this is why there is not any commit available.
