# Nextjs-learning-chakraui

I did all working on this and pushed time to time on repository "nextjs-learning" <br/>
but in that repo there were already three projects, <br />
I was using that repo on the Vercel too for deploying the projects <br />
And when I tried to deploy my fourth project which is "panaverse-dao-web", <br />
I got an error on vercel that one repository can only be used for max of three projects deployment. Because we are using free account over vercel <br /> <br />

So that's why I have created this repository and moved my project here <br />
this is why there is not any commit available.
